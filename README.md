# 🗂️ Bryan Suello's Dotfiles: The Organized Chaos

Welcome to the wonderful world of my dotfiles! A collection of configurations that may look like a digital hurricane hit my home directory, but trust me, there’s a method to this madness. 

## 🧹 Why So Cluttered?

Like a good artist’s studio, my dotfiles reflect creativity in chaos. Over the years, they’ve accumulated (much like dust bunnies) through various experiments and explorations. It’s not perfect, but it’s *perfectly me*.
